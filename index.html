I have faced storms, monsters, and men who wish to see me dead. Many times, I have been close to losing hope, but the thought of you gives me strength. I know you are waiting for me. One day, I will stand before you again. Wait for me, my love. I am coming home.",

Do you miss me as I miss you? I long to see your face and hold you once more. I do not know how long this war will last, but my love for you remains unbroken. Until the day I return, my heart is yours."

If you are alive, return to me, for no one else could take your place. I will wait for you always.",

Come back to me, my love."
